<h3>A Simple Hydrologic Model (the 'Bucket' Model)</h3> 
<br>
The simplest hydrologic model is a 'Bucket' model for the surface(i.e soil, snow, ice,vegetation). In this model, 
<ul>
<li>A portion of the precipitation will leave as it is evaporated.</li>
<li>A portion of precipitation will infiltrate into the
bucket (simulating the build up of surface/soil moisture).</li>
<li>The bucket will fill up (simulating the amount of water the surface can hold due to its type, depth and present saturation).</li>
<li> When the bucket is full (surface is saturated with water), excess precipitation will overflow the rim of the bucket(simulating surface runoff of precipitation).</li> 
<li>Water can also leave the bucket from holes in the saturated zones (simulating base flow) and unsaturated zones(simulating inter flow). 
</li>

Figure: Structure of a Simple Hydrologic Bucket Model. Here, water enters the region via precipitation and can leave via evapotranspiration. Soil infiltration decides what portion of the precipitation enters the bucket. The bucket represents the maximum water content of the unsaturated portion of the soil. The total runoff is made up of water that overflows the bucket (i.e. overland flow), flow from the saturated zone (i.e. base flow) and flow from the unsaturated zone (i.e. inter flow). </i>
