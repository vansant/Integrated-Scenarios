<h3>ULM Hydrology Model</h3> 
<br>
The ULM model (Livneh et al., 2011) is essentially a merger of two well established models: the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC) and the Noah Land Surface Model. ULM uses the vegetation, snow, frozen soil, and evapotranspiration components of Noah and the soil moisture accounting capability of SAC.
<br><br>

<b>ULM Inputs:</b><br>
Meteorological drivers for the model are input as time series of daily variables such as precipitation, air
temperature and wind speed. 
<br><br>

<b>ULM Outputs:</b><br>
ULM outputs time series of many different variables from the simulation process. These include variables related to snow (snow water equivalents , snow melt),
soil (moisture,temperature, heat flux),  runoff(subsurface/surface,total), streamflow, evapotranspiration(water,saturated soil, short/tall vegetation), sensible/latent heat, radiation(shortwave/longwave).
