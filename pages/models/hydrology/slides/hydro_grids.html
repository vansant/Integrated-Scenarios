<h3>Hydrology Model Discretization</h3> 
<br>
Hydrologic models simplify our 3 dimensional world into discrete components that can
be simulated in a computer. For these models, the land surface is divided up into discrete regions (either rectangular grid cells or a tiling of the surface into irregular regions) and the surface 
is divided up into discrete layers(vegetation canopy and soil). Further, each region has an elevation model.

Hydrology models do some sub-grid discretization as well. 
For example, the fraction of each grid cell that is covered by 
different vegetation types or is covered by snow/ice is figured into the model. 
However, outputs are reported only as averages over all of the sub-grid discretizations.
