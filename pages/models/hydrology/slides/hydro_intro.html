<h3>Hydrology Models</h3> 
<br>

Hydrologic models are computer simulations of the water cycle using a simplified representation of the land surface and hydrologic processes. <br>

<b> Stochastic vs Deterministic</b>
The two major types of hydrologic models are stochastic and deterministic. 
<ul><li>In stochastic simulations, 
the meteorological inputs are mapped to hydrologic outputs via statistical relationships. </li>
<li>In deterministic simulations, the physical processes and interactions in the real world are simulated 
so that they typically contain representations of surface runoff, subsurface flow, evapotranspiration, and channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. </li>
</ul>
 <br>
<b>Single-Event or Continuous Simulations</b>
Deterministic process-based models can further be subdivided into single-event models or continuous simulation models. 
<ul>
<li>Single-event models simulate the hydrology for just a single instance in time (or a short window). These are typically used to model single storm events and are often used for design purposes (i.e. designing a culvert to pass the 100-year event). </li>
<li>Continuous simulations are initialized and then run for many contiguous time steps to establish a time series of hydrologic outputs. 
These simulations are usually used to simulate flow and other watershed functions over long periods of time.
Often model runs are preceded by initialization runs to establish equilibrium conditions (i.e soil moisture) in the model.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
The two hydrologic models used in the Integrated Scenarios project are deterministic models using continuous simulations.
