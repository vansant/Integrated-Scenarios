<h3>ULM Soil Moisture Model (SAC)</h3> 
<br>
ULM uses the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA; Burnash, 1995 ) for its soil moisture model.SAC-SMA is a complex conceptual hydrologic model and is used extensively in hydrologic prediction by the National Weather Service. It is based on conceptualizing the soil profile as a series of reservoirs with capacities and release coefficients.

<b>Soil Moisture Accounting</b><br>
The SAC model is a lumped hydrologic continuous simulation model. SAC has model components for water tension, free water, surface flow, lateral drainage, evapotranspiration and percolation. 
SAC represents soil moisture such that applied moisture is distributed properly at various depths and energy states in the soil, rational percolation characteristics are maintained and streamflow is simulated effectively.  
In the Sac-SMA model, evapotranspiration (ET) is currently computed from monthly average potential evaporation estimates derived from national pan evaporation data.  Runoff generation is conceptualized from saturation excess physics that is most appropriate for humid environments.
