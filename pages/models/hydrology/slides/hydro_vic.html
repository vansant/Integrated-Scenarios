<h3>VIC Hydrology Model</h3> 

The VIC model (Liang et al., 1994) is a large-scale, semi-distributed hydrologic model 
that simulates the hydrology in land-surface processes by incorporating variable vegetation, soil types and topography. It is semi-distributed in that it has grid cells, but also a channel network to handle surface/subsurface runoff. Like other land surface models, in VIC:
<ul>
<li>Grid cells are simulated independently of each other</li>
<li>Inputs are time series of daily meteorological variables(precipitation, air temperature, wind speed)</li>
<li>Water can only enter a grid cell via the atmosphere</li>
<li>Land-atmosphere fluxes and water/energy balances at the surface are simulated at daily time steps</li>
<li>Non-channel flow between grid cells is ignored. Once water reaches the channel network, it is assumed to stay in the channel (it cannot flow back into the soil).</li>
</ul>
