<h3>Hydrologic Models Processes</h3> 
<br>
<b>Fate of Precipitation:</b>
At each time step, a hydrology model must determine what happens to one unit of onset precipitation. Portions of this precipitation will go toward 1) evaporation back to the atmosphere, 2) 'infiltration'(or absorption) into the surface and 3) surface runoff out of the cell.

<b>Evapotranspiration:</b>
Hydrology models often model the evaporation of water from a cell as a function of temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed and albedo of the surface.
<br><br>
<b>Infiltration:</b>
Infiltration is the process by which water on the ground surface is absorbed by the surface. 
Infiltration is dependent on the surface type (soil, vegetation, ice, snow), surface depth and the degree to which the surface is already saturated. 
<br><br>
<b>Runoff: </b>Runoff is the flow of water that occurs when excess stormwater, meltwater, or other sources cannot be absorbed by the surface and must leave the region. Total runoff is composed of runoff from the surface (aka overland flow), runoff from the saturated region of the soil (aka base flow) and runoff from the unsaturated region of the soil(aka inter flow). Overland flow can happen when rain arrives more quickly than the surface can absorb or when impervious areas (concrete) funnel runoff into the region.
